    <h2>About Turtle hatcheries in Sri Lanka </h2>
          <p><em>Sri Lanka is home to five species of sea turtles, all of which are endangered. Turtle hatcheries have been established in several areas along the coast to protect these species and their eggs from predators and human activities. Here's some information on turtle hatcheries in Sri Lanka:</em></p>

<p><em>Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery: Located in the town of Kosgoda, this hatchery is one of the most popular in Sri Lanka. It was established in 1981 with the aim of protecting sea turtles and their eggs. The hatchery provides a safe environment for turtle eggs to hatch and for the baby turtles to grow before being released into the ocean. Visitors can see the hatchery and learn about the different species of turtles found in Sri Lanka.</em></p>

<p><em>Bentota Turtle Hatchery: This hatchery is located in the town of Bentota and was established in 1986. The hatchery's main goal is to protect the eggs and hatchlings of sea turtles that are threatened by human activities such as beach erosion and commercial fishing. Visitors can see the hatchery and learn about the different species of turtles found in Sri Lanka.</em></p>

<p><em>Rekawa Turtle Conservation Project: This conservation project is located in the village of Rekawa and was established in 1996. The project aims to protect sea turtles and their nesting sites along the Rekawa beach. The project also monitors the hatching of turtle eggs and helps baby turtles make their way safely to the ocean. Visitors can see the project and learn about the different species of turtles found in Sri Lanka.</em></p>

          <p><em>Sea Turtle Farm & Hatchery: This hatchery is located in the town of Habaraduwa and was established in 1986. The hatchery's main goal is to protect the eggs and hatchlings of sea turtles that are threatened by human activities such as beach erosion and commercial fishing. Visitors can see the hatchery and learn about the different species of turtles found in Sri Lanka.</em></p>

          <p><em>These hatcheries provide important protection for Sri Lanka's endangered sea turtles, and they also serve as educational centers for visitors to learn about these amazing animals and the threats they face.</em></p>
